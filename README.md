A-star path algorithm I made in Unity. Full documentation is available [here](https://github.com/romanokeser/A-star-algorithm-in-Unity/blob/main/report%201%20-%20unfinished.pdf), where I explain how the algorithm itself is working with step-by-step explanation and screenshots included.

Things to be changed: 

- optimization, adding *content* and fixing grammar mistakes in the report 
- implementing this algorithm into a game.
